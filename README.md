# NYTimes-articles-classification-using-SparkML-PySpark-and-MLib.
The objective of the project is to achieve the following outlines.

1. Explore the Apache Spark framework and programming: spark context (sc), dataflow operations in transformations, actions, pipelines and MLib.
2. Apply your data analytics knowledge (word frequency, word-co-occurrence) and machine learning skills to perform multi-class classification of text data using Apache Spark.
3. Build a data pipeline using
a. Data from sources such as NY Times articles using the APIs provided by the data sources.
b. Split the data into training and test data set.
c. Extract features that will determine the class or category of the article {politics, sports, business, one of your choice}
d. Build a model for classification using any two of the several classification algorithms.
e. Assess the accuracy using a query text or new article for each news “category”
f. Compare the classification accuracy of at least two well-known classification algorithms, for a given text data set.
